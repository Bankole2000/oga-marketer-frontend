                One of they key requirements and changes is that your Privacy
                Policy will need to be updated to reflect GDPR requirements.
                <br />
                The purpose of this post is to get you better acquianted with
                the GDPR and show you what your Privacy Policy agreement should
                look like with the GDPR in mind.

                The GDPR is a new data and privacy security legislation which
                was developed by the European Parliament and Council for the
                protection of data rights of teh EU citizens. Companies
                (including websites, mobile and desktop apps etc) that do
                business transactions with EU citizens are going to be affected
                by this regulation
              </p>
              <p>
                On May 25th, 2018, the GDPR replaced the existing data
                protection law i.e. the Data Protection Directive that has been
                in effect since 1998. If your company collects or processes the
                data of EU citizens, you are required to comply with this
                regulation. Non-compliance can result in hefty fines of up to
                &euro; 20 million or 4% of annual revenues, whichever is higher.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the key aims and requirements of the GDPR is to keep EU
                citizens informed of how businesses collect, use share, secure
                and process their personal data.
              </p>
              <p>
                Under the GDPR, you are required to inform your customers about
                why you are processing their data and for how long you will
                store it. You must tell them in plan and clear words how you use
                their data.<br />
